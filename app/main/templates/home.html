                <p> In Norse mythology, Odin had two ravens perched on his shoulder named Huginn (thought) and Muninn (memory). Their purpose was to fly into the world at dawn and observe all that went on in the world. At dinner time, they would then fly back to Odin and whisper all of the knowledge they had gained in their flight. Thus, Odin was kept current in all the events of the world on a daily basis. </p>

                <p> This ancient story really struck a chord with me because I seek to bring thought, Huginn, and combine it with knowledge, Muninn. I believe that the insight gleaned from thought and knowledge can help a person or organization to make better informed decisions and allow them to be the best at what they do. Whether that is performing a quick one time analysis of sales data or seeking insight into long term trend analysis, I love to dive into data and answer questions and tell the world a story.

                <p>While I may not have two ravens that will circle the world and whisper what they've learned into my ear, I do have access to tools that I can use to provide me with knowledge and help me gain insight. Over the years I've learned to use tools such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>SQL</li>
                    <li>Python, to include:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>- Pandas</li>
                            <li>- Numpy</li>

                <p>I love to code and learn new technology that inspires me to find new insight into the world around me.</p>

                <p>As I complete various projects to fire my passion, I will add them here to show what I am capable of creating and learning!</p>
